# Quickstart Templates

This folder will include Markdown or YAML templates consumed by quickstart scripts, such as:
- `report-template.md` for summarizing benchmark output.
- `config-template.yaml` containing reusable sections shared across quickstart configs.

Add concrete templates once reporting format is finalized.
