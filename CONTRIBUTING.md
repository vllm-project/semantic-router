## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Go** 1.24.1 or later
- **Hugging Face CLI** (`pip install huggingface_hub`)
- **Make** (for build automation)
- **Python** 3.8+ (Optional: for training and testing)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router.git
   cd semantic-router
   ```

2. **Download required models:**
   ```bash
   make download-models
   ```
   This downloads the pre-trained classification models from Hugging Face.

3. **Install Python dependencies(Optional):**
   ```bash
   # For training and development
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For end-to-end testing
   pip install -r e2e-tests/requirements.txt
   ```

## Building the Project

The project consists of multiple components that need to be built in order:

### Build Everything
```bash
make build
```

### Build Individual Components

1. **Rust library (Candle binding):**
   ```bash
   make rust
   ```

2. **Go router:**
   ```bash
   make build-router
   ```

### Running the System

1. **Start Envoy proxy** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   make run-envoy
   ```

2. **Start the semantic router** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   make run-router
   ```

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

1. **Test Rust bindings:**
   ```bash
   make test-binding
   ```

2. **Test Go semantic router:**
   ```bash
   make test-semantic-router
   ```

3. **Test individual classifiers:**
   ```bash
   make test-category-classifier
   make test-pii-classifier
   make test-jailbreak-classifier
   ```

### Manual Testing

Test different routing scenarios:

```bash
# Test model auto-selection
make test-prompt

# Test PII detection
make test-pii

# Test prompt guard (jailbreak detection)
make test-prompt-guard

# Test tools auto-selection
make test-tools
```

### End-to-End Tests

Ensure both Envoy and the router are running, then:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
python e2e-tests/run_all_tests.py

# Run specific test
python e2e-tests/00-client-request-test.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
python e2e-tests/run_all_tests.py --pattern "0*-*.py"

# Check if services are running
python e2e-tests/run_all_tests.py --check-only
```

The test suite includes:

+ Basic client request tests
+ Envoy ExtProc interaction tests
+ Router classification tests
+ Semantic cache tests
+ Category-specific tests
+ Metrics validation tests

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the project structure and coding standards.

3. **Build and test:**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make build
   make test
   ```

4. **Run end-to-end tests:**
   ```bash
   # Start services
   make run-envoy &
   make run-router &
   
   # Run tests
   python e2e-tests/run_all_tests.py
   ```

5. **Commit your changes:**

   Commit your changes with a clear message, making sure to **sign off** on your work using the `-s` flag. This is required by the project's **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -s -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

### Debugging

- **Envoy logs:** Check the terminal running `make run-envoy` for detailed request/response logs
- **Router logs:** Check the terminal running `make run-router` for classification and routing decisions
- **Rust library:** Use `RUST_LOG=debug` environment variable for detailed Rust logs

## Code Style and Standards

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting a PR, please run the pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. **These checks are mandatory** and will be automatically run on every commit once installed.

**Step 1: Install pre-commit tool**
```bash
# Using pip (recommended)
pip install pre-commit

# Or using conda
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit

# Or using homebrew (macOS)
brew install pre-commit
```

**Step 2: Install pre-commit hooks for this repository**
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run all checks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Go Code
- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- **Keep Go modules tidy:** Run `go mod tidy` in the appropriate directory after adding or removing dependencies
  - For `candle-binding`: `cd candle-binding && go mod tidy`
  - For `src/semantic-router`: `cd src/semantic-router && go mod tidy`
  - The CI will automatically check that `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are tidy using `make check-go-mod-tidy`

### Rust Code
- Follow Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Handle errors appropriately with `Result` types
- Document public APIs

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes

## Submitting Changes

1. **Ensure all tests pass:**
   ```bash
   make test
   python e2e-tests/run_all_tests.py
   ```

   The `make test` command includes:
   - `go vet` for static analysis
   - `check-go-mod-tidy` for Go module dependency verification
   - Unit tests for all components

2. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Test results and validation steps

3. **Address review feedback** promptly
