## Prompts Routing (Tested & Verified)

These prompts have **100% classification accuracy** and route as follows:

| Category | Example Prompt | Routes To | Confidence |
|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Math** | "Is 17 a prime number?" | Model-B* | ~0.326 |
| **Chemistry** | "What are atoms made of?" | Model-B* | ~0.196 |
| **Chemistry** | "Explain oxidation and reduction" | Model-B* | ~0.200 |
| **Chemistry** | "Explain chemical equilibrium" | Model-B* | ~0.197 |
| **History** | "What were the main causes of World War I?" | Model-B* | ~0.218 |
| **History** | "What was the Cold War?" | Model-B* | ~0.219 |
| **Psychology** | "What is the nature vs nurture debate?" | Model-B | ~0.391 |
| **Psychology** | "What are the stages of grief?" | Model-B | ~0.403 |
| **Health** | "How to maintain a healthy lifestyle?" | Model-B | ~0.221 |
| **Health** | "What is a balanced diet?" | Model-B | ~0.268 |

## Reasoning Mode (Chain-of-Thought)

Categories with **reasoning enabled** use extended thinking for complex problems:

- ✅ **Math** (Model-A) - Step-by-step mathematical solutions
- ✅ **Chemistry** (Model-A) - Complex chemical reactions and analysis
- ✅ **Physics** (Model-A) - Mathematical derivations and proofs

---

## Default Behavior

- **Default Model:** Model-A
- **Fallback Category:** "other" (score: 0.7)
- **Unmatched queries** route to Model-A with the "other" category system prompt

### Key Parameters:

- **name:** Category identifier
- **system_prompt:** Specialized prompt for this category
- **model_scores.model:** Target model (Model-A or Model-B)
- **model_scores.score:** Routing priority (0.0 to 1.0)
- **use_reasoning:** Enable extended thinking mode

## Confidence Scores Explained

**Why are confidence scores low (0.2-0.4)?**

1. **Softmax across 14 categories** - Even the "winning" category may only get 20-40% probability
2. **Relative, not absolute** - Scores are compared against other categories
3. **Consistency matters** - Same prompt always gets same category (100% in our tests)
4. **Highest score wins** - 0.326 for "math" means it beat all other 13 categories

**What's important:**

- ✅ Classification is **consistent** across multiple runs
- ✅ Same prompt → same category every time
- ✅ Confidence is **relative** to other categories, not absolute certainty
