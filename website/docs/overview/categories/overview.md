# Category Overview

The Category system is the intelligence core of vLLM Semantic Router, enabling intelligent query classification and routing decisions based on semantic understanding of user inputs.

## What is the Category System?

The Category system automatically analyzes incoming queries to determine their **semantic intent** and **domain classification**. This classification drives intelligent routing decisions, ensuring that each query is handled by the most appropriate model and configuration.

### Key Concepts

- **Category Classification**: Automatic identification of query domains (e.g., "math", "computer science", "business")
- **Semantic Understanding**: Deep analysis of query meaning beyond simple keyword matching
- **Routing Intelligence**: Dynamic model selection based on category-specific configurations
- **Reasoning Control**: Category-aware activation of reasoning capabilities

## How Categories Work in Semantic Routing

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Category Classifier]
    B --> C{Classification Confidence}
    C -->|High Confidence| D[Category-Specific Route]
    C -->|Low Confidence| E[Default Route]

    D --> F[Apply Category Rules]
    F --> G[Select Specialized Model]
    F --> H[Enable Reasoning if Configured]
    F --> I[Apply Category Filters]

    E --> J[Use Default Model]

    G --> K[Route to Selected Model]
    H --> K
    I --> K
    J --> K

    K --> L[Generate Response]
```

### Classification Process

1. **Input Analysis**: The ModernBERT-based classifier analyzes the semantic content of the query
2. **Category Prediction**: The system predicts the most likely category with a confidence score
3. **Threshold Evaluation**: If confidence exceeds the configured threshold, category-specific routing is applied
4. **Fallback Handling**: Low-confidence classifications fall back to default routing behavior

## Category-Driven Features

### 1. Model Selection

Categories enable intelligent model selection based on domain expertise:

```yaml
categories:
- name: math
  model_scores:
  - model: specialized-math-model
    score: 1.0
  - model: general-model
    score: 0.6
```

### 2. Reasoning Control

Categories can automatically enable reasoning for complex domains:

```yaml
categories:
- name: computer science
  use_reasoning: true
  reasoning_effort: high
  reasoning_description: "Programming problems require step-by-step analysis"
```

### 3. Filter Application

Different categories can trigger specific processing filters:

- **PII Detection**: Enhanced privacy protection for sensitive domains
- **Tool Selection**: Domain-specific tool availability
- **Semantic Caching**: Category-aware cache optimization
