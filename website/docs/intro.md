An intelligent **Mixture-of-Models (MoM)** router that acts as an Envoy External Processor (ExtProc) to intelligently direct OpenAI API requests to the most suitable backend model from a defined pool. Using BERT-based semantic understanding and classification, it optimizes both performance and cost efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎯 **Auto-selection of Models**
Intelligently routes requests to specialized models based on semantic understanding:

- **Math queries** → Math-specialized models
- **Creative writing** → Creative-specialized models  
- **Code generation** → Code-specialized models
- **General queries** → Balanced general-purpose models

### 🛡️ **Security & Privacy**

- **PII Detection**: Automatically detects and handles personally identifiable information
- **Prompt Guard**: Identifies and blocks jailbreak attempts
- **Safe Routing**: Ensures sensitive prompts are handled appropriately

### ⚡ **Performance Optimization**

- **Semantic Cache**: Caches semantic representations to reduce latency
- **Tool Selection**: Auto-selects relevant tools to reduce token usage and improve tool selection accuracy

### 🏗️ **Architecture**

- **Envoy ExtProc Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Envoy proxy
- **Dual Implementation**: Available in both Go (with Rust FFI) and Python
- **Scalable Design**: Production-ready with comprehensive monitoring

## 📊 Performance Benefits

Our testing shows significant improvements in model accuracy through specialized routing:

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Enterprise API Gateways**: Route different types of queries to cost-optimized models
- **Multi-tenant Platforms**: Provide specialized routing for different customer needs
- **Development Environments**: Balance cost and performance for different workloads
- **Production Services**: Ensure optimal model selection with built-in safety measures

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

The router provides comprehensive monitoring through:

- **Grafana Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and performance tracking
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Detailed routing statistics and performance data
- **Request Tracing**: Full visibility into routing decisions and performance
