package headers

// Package headers provides constants for all custom HTTP headers used in the semantic router.
// All custom headers follow the "x-" prefix convention for non-standard HTTP headers.

// Request Headers
// These headers are used in incoming requests to the semantic router.

// VSR Decision Tracking Headers
// These headers are added to successful responses (HTTP 200-299) to track
// Vector Semantic Router decision-making information for debugging and monitoring.
// Headers are only added when the request is successful and did not hit the cache.
