# Governance

## Overview

Our project follows a lightweight, consensus-driven governance model.

## Maintainers

The project's core maintainers are defined in the root [`OWNER`](./OWNER) file.
Maintainers are responsible for technical direction, release coordination, and
ensuring community health.

## Code Ownership

Ownership is distributed across the repository through per-directory `OWNER` files.
Each file lists the reviewers responsible for that area. A full index of all
`OWNER` file locations is maintained in [`CODEOWNERS`](./CODEOWNERS).

## How Decisions Are Made

Changes are proposed via pull requests and require approval from the relevant
owner(s). For larger or cross-cutting changes, maintainers reach consensus
through discussion on the PR or in community meetings.

## Path to Maintainership

Contributors who make sustained, high-quality contributions across the project
may be nominated by an existing maintainer. Addition requires agreement from
all current maintainers.

## Community Channels

- **Slack:** `#semantic-router` in vLLM Slack
- **Meetings:** Bi-weekly, listed in the [README](./README.md#community-meetings-)
