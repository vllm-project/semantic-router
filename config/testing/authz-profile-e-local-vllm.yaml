# Profile E: Local vLLM backend (fail-open)
#
# FAIL-OPEN: allows requests through without API keys. Use ONLY when routing
# to local vLLM/Ollama backends that don't require authentication.
#
# WARNING: With fail_open=true, if ext_authz is misconfigured or down, requests
# will silently proceed without per-user keys. The router logs a WARN for each
# such request so operators can detect the issue via monitoring.
#
# Do NOT use this profile when routing to external LLM providers (OpenAI,
# Anthropic, etc.) — those requests will fail with 401 at the provider side.

  fail_open: true              # allow requests without keys (local backends only)
