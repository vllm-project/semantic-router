# Profile C: Static keys only (no ext_authz)
#
# Skips header-injection entirely. Useful for:
#   - Local development without Authorino / ext_authz
#   - Simple deployments where a single API key per model is sufficient
#   - Testing without running an authorization service
#
# FAIL-CLOSED: if a model's access_key is empty, the request is rejected.
# This catches missing config instead of sending unauthenticated requests
# to LLM providers (which would return cryptic 401 errors).

authz:
  fail_open: false             # reject if access_key is missing
