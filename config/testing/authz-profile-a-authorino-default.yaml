# Profile A: Authorino / Standard ext_authz (default — zero config)
#
# When the "authz" section is omitted entirely, the router uses the default chain:
#   1. header-injection (reads x-user-openai-key, x-user-anthropic-key)
#   2. static-config    (reads model_config.*.access_key)
#
# Default behavior is FAIL-CLOSED: if no provider resolves a key, the request
# is rejected with a clear error (401). This prevents silent bypass from
# Authorino downtime, header name mismatches, or missing static config.
#
# This is the recommended profile for Authorino deployments.
# No authz config needed — just ensure Authorino injects the standard headers.
#
# authz:           ← intentionally omitted (defaults to fail_open: false)
