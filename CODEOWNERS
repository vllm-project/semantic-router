# CODEOWNERS for vLLM Semantic Router
#
# Code ownership in this project is managed through per-directory OWNER files.
# Each OWNER file lists the GitHub handles responsible for reviewing changes
# in that directory. The owner-notification.yml workflow uses these files to
# automatically assign reviewers on pull requests.
#
# This file serves as an index to those OWNER files.
#
# Root owners (fallback reviewers for any unmatched path):
#   ./OWNER                        — @rootfs, @Xunzhuo
#
